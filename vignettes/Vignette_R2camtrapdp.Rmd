## Data
If you have deployment and observation data.
```{r}
data("Vdep")
data("Vobs")
```

## Create deployment
Using deployment data (e.g., Vdep), deployment (tibble data) was created as below,
```{r}
##create deployment
deployments<-create_deployments(
  deploymentID=Vdep$deploymentID,
  longitude=Vdep$longitude,
  latitude=Vdep$latitude,
  locationID=Vdep$locationID,
  deploymentStart_date=Vdep$startDate,
  deploymentStart_time=Vdep$startTime,
  deploymentEnd_date=Vdep$endDate,
  deploymentEnd_time=Vdep$endTime,
  cameraID=Vdep$cameraID,
  cameraModel=Vdep$cameraModel,
  cameraDelay=Vdep$Delay,
  cameraHeight=Vdep$Height,
  baitUse=Vdep$bait,
  setupBy=Vdep$setupBy)
```

## Create media
Using deployment and observation data (e.g., Vdep and Vobs), media (tibble data) was created as below,
```{r}
##settings
#media ID
mediaID<-paste(Vobs$institutionCode,
               Vobs$collectionCode,
               Vobs$locationID,
               as.numeric(factor(Vobs$filename)),
               sep="_")
#capture method
capturemethod<-"activityDetection"
nmedia<-length(mediaID)
captureMethod<-rep(capturemethod,nmedia)

#filePath
filePath<-paste("Video")

#fileName
fileName<-Vobs$filename
filetype<-tolower(unlist(lapply(strsplit(fileName,"\\."),"[",2)))

#filePublic
fileMediatype<-paste("video",filetype,sep="/")
filePublic<-!grepl("ヒト",fileName)

##create media
media<-create_media( mediaID=mediaID,
                     deploymentID=Vdep$deploymentID,
                     timestamp_date=Vobs$date,

                     captureMethod="activityDetection",
                     fileName=fileName)
```

## Create observation
Using observation data (e.g., Vobs), observation (tibble data) was created as below,
```{r}
#If the observations were media-based observations, observationLevel expressed as "media"
observationLevel<-"media"

#If the observations classified by human, classificationmethod expressed as "humam" 
classificationmethod<-"human"
#classificationprobability is the degree of certainty of the classification of the observed object (1=maximum certainty)
classificationprobability<-1

#create observationIDs that express the unique identifier of the observation 
observationID<-paste(mediaID,Vobs$pictID,sep="_")
#deploymentID is belong to deployment
deploymentID<-Vdep$deploymentID
#mediaID is belong to media
mediaID<-mediaID

#Timestamp (date and time) at which the observation started (e.g., the timestamp when the video or photo was taken)
tz="Japan"
timestamp<-paste(Vobs$date,Vobs$time)

#categorized observationType (animal, human, vehicle, blank, unknown, or unclassified)
observationType<-ifelse(Vobs$object=="hito","human",
                        ifelse(Vobs$object=="none","blank",
                               ifelse(Vobs$object=="unidentifiable","unknown","animal")))

#Scientific name of the animals observed
scientificName<-ifelse(is.na(Vobs$genus),Vobs$class,paste(Vobs$genus,Vobs$species))

#create observations
observations<-create_observations(observationID=observationID,
                                  deploymentID=deploymentID,
                                       mediaID=mediaID,
                                       eventStart=timestamp,
                                       eventEnd=timestamp,
                                       observationLevel=observationLevel,
                                       observationType=observationType,
                                       scientificName=scientificName,
                                       count=Vobs$individualCount,
                                       classificationMethod=classificationmethod,
                                       classificationProbability=classificationprobability
)

```

## Create datapackages
##1.Create an R6 object with named "datapackage"
```{r}
datapackage<-R6_CamtrapDP$new()
```

##2.Import tibble data (deployment, media and observation) into "datapackage"
The functions "set_deployments()", "set_media()", and "set_observations()" can be used as below;
```{r}
#set deployments
datapackage$set_deployments(deployments)
#set media
datapackage$set_media(media)
#set observations
datapackage$set_observations(observations)

```

##3.Import metadata (e.g., contributors, licences, and properties) into "datapackage"
For the metadata of Camera Trap Data Package (Camtrap DP), five properties (contributors, project, spatial, temporal and taxonomic, and created) are required. In addition, six properties can be used for additional information of metadata.

##3-1.Required Properties
##3-1-1.Contributors
The function "add_contributors()" can be used to import a data frame of contributors. The contributor data frame consists of title, email, path, role, and organization.
title: Name of contributor
email: e-mail address of contributor
path: URL for the contributor's web page
role: Role of contributor. Defaults to contributor. Other role can use from contact, principalInvestigator, rightsHolder and publisher
organization: organization of contributor
Import contributors into "datapackage" as below,
```{r}
#create dataframe of contributors
cd<-data.frame(title=c("Keita Fukasawa", "Kana Terayama"),
               email=c("fukasawa@nies.go.jp","terayama.kana@nies.go.jp"),
               path=c("https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0272-9180","https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6935-7233"),
               role=as.factor(c("contact","principalInvestigator")),
               organization=c("National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES)","National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES)"))
datapackage$add_contributors(cd)

```

##3-1-2.Project
The information of Camera trap project or study that originated the package. For project, title, samplingDesign, captureMethod, individualAnimals, and observationLevel are need to be filled in. In addition, id, acronym, description, path are available as additional information.
[Required information]
title: Title of the project
samplingDesign: Type of sampling design/layout. The values can be used from simpleRandom, systematicRandom, clusteredRandom, experimental, targeted, or opportunistic.

##3-1-4.Taxonomic
Taxonomic coverage of the "datapackage", based on the unique "scientificName" of "observation".
The "set_taxon()" function lists scientific name of observation and collect taxonID from taxon data base (express as taxonDB). For default, taxonDB is "itis" and taxonDBurl (An URL to taxon data base) is "https://www.itis.gov/". You can use other taxonDB and taxonDBurl (see details in "taxadb::get_ids").
```{r}
datapackage$set_taxon()
```

##3-1-5.Created

##3-2-6.Custom Information
If you have some of the "datapackage" information as metadata, but it is not listed in the above sections, the "set_custom()" function will help. This function can be used to list new data from a data frame, and the values of name, description , and of course data frame are required. 
For example,suppose you have a data frame for estimating animal abundance based on the REST method. The code is as follows, 
```{r}
#data frame of REST data (This is dummy data)
RD<-data.frame(id=seq(1:38),
               Time=sample(1:29,38,replace=T))
##add REST data as medatada
datapackage$set_custom(name=c("REST"),
                       description = c("dataforRESTmethod"),
                       data=RD)
```

##4.Convert and output as Camtrap DP object
The R6class object (i.e., "datapackage") can be converted to the Camtrap DP object using the "out_camtrapdp()" function, as shown below,  
```{r}
data_camtrapdp<-datapackage$out_camtrapdp()
```
If you want, "datapackage" can be converted to the Camtrap DP object and created in the directory (described by path), as shown below,  
```{r}
datapackage$out_camtrapdp(write=T,directory=path)
```
